     Observed Output - Ivalid Choice ! Enter a number between 1 to 4

6) Do you want to perform another calculation (yes/no) : 
    Input - "yeS", "YES", "yes", "Yes", "No", "nO", "NO", "no"
    Expected Output - Should accept all variatons as Yes\No (case-insensitive).
    Observed Output - It is accepting all the variations of yes\no.
